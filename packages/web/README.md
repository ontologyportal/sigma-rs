## 3D hierarchy

Under Explore, choose the **Visualize** tab. Entity starts at the center;
terms are shaded spheres connected by subclass, instance, subrelation, and
subAttribute assertions. Larger visible subtrees receive proportionally more
angular space, and successive branches continue outward. Multiple parents
remain connected even though positioning uses a cycle-safe spanning tree.

Drag to orbit, scroll or use the zoom buttons to zoom, and Shift-drag to pan.
With the canvas focused, arrow keys rotate, +/- zoom, and Home resets the view.
Click a sphere or use the searchable term list to center the view on it, inspect its
parents and children, and open its term page. Rotation and zoom stay unchanged
when focusing a term; subsequent rotation orbits that term. Reset view returns
to Entity. Relationship checkboxes filter
the reachable graph; labels can be hidden.

The default view loads four levels from the current knowledge base. Choose
more levels or All for deeper exploration. Views are limited to 6,000 terms
and explicitly marked when partial. Branch weights describe the visible
subtree, not a count of unloaded descendants. Reload refreshes the view;
knowledge-base reprocessing also reloads it automatically.

Run the layout and traversal tests from the repository root:

```bash
node --test packages/web/src/services/taxonomy-3d.test.mjs
```
